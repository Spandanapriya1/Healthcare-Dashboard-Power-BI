# Healthcare-Dashboard-Power-BI
Healthcare Dashboard is a Power BI project that helps with decision-making by visualizing important hospital parameters such as patient statistics, occupancy, revenue, and treatment efficiency.

**Healthcare Analytics Dashboard**

**Project Overview**

A complete data visualization and reporting solution designed using Power BI, the Healthcare Analytics Dashboard improves hospital management and decision-making. Real-time information on patient numbers, hospital occupancy, income, treatment effectiveness, and operational performance is available on this dashboard. This system ensures better patient care, efficient use of resources, and increased hospital efficiency by enabling physicians, hospital managers, and legislators to make data-driven decisions through the integration of numerous data sources.

**Objective**

This project's main objective is to create an interactive, data-driven dashboard that centralizes hospital data so that patient demographics, medical departments, financial data, and overall healthcare performance can be better monitored.

**Key Features & Functionalities**

**1. Hospital Summary Overview**

Total Patients: Shows the total number of hospitalized patients.
 Admitted vs. Outpatient Count: This helps determine hospital capacity by distinguishing between inpatients and outpatients.
Total Staff Count: Keeps tabs on how many medical professionals and support personnel are currently on duty.
Occupied Beds: This helps hospitals effectively manage their capacity by displaying the current bed occupancy rate.
Average Treatment Cost: This helps with financial analysis by giving an estimate of hospital costs per patient.
Total Revenue Generation: A graphic representation of the money received from various patient groups and therapies.

**2. Patient Demographics & Classification**

Gender Distribution: The percentage of male versus female patients is shown in a pie chart.
Age Group Analysis divides patients into age groups, such as those under six, six to twenty, twenty to forty, forty to sixty, and over sixty.
ICU, Normal, Discharge, Readmission, and Death are some of the classifications for patient admission status.

**3. Department-Wise Analysis**

Department Breakdown: Monitors the distribution of patients throughout several departments, including orthopedics, neurology, cardiology, oncology, surgery, and more.
Status by Department: Examines the health of patients by department, including those who have died, been released from the intensive care unit, or been admitted.
Emergency Room (ER) Time by Department: Offers information on typical wait and treatment durations for various medical specialties.

**4. Length of Stay (LOS) & Patient Flow Analysis**

Average LOS by Age Group: This calculates the typical length of stay for patients according to their age.
LOS Breakdown by Treatment Type: Assists in determining which medical procedures necessitate prolonged hospital stays.
In and Out Flow Tracking: Weekly patterns illustrating patient admissions and outflows.

**5. Financial & Revenue Insights**

Revenue by Age Group: Shows which age groups make up the largest portion of hospital revenue.
Revenue Trends Over Time: Aids in budgetary allocation and financial planning.
Patient Cost Analysis: Examines the expenses for each patient according to different treatment types.

**6. Patient Satisfaction & Feedback Analysis**

Knowledge of Treatment Feedback: Gathers opinions from patients regarding how well doctors explained things.
Age-Group Satisfaction Ratings: Tracks patient satisfaction levels to enhance the caliber of services.
Patient Experience Metrics: Monitors hospital service ratings with interactive graphics.

**Technology Stack**

Power BI: Used for data visualization and interactive reporting.
SQL Database → Stores patient records and medical history data.
Excel/CSV Files → Data input sources for analysis.
Azure Maps Integration → (Optional) To visualize patient geographical distribution.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for advanced calculations and custom measures in Power BI.

**Benefits & Impact of the Project**

**1.Improved Decision-Making**

For hospital administrators and legislators, the dashboard offers real-time, data-driven insights that facilitate prompt and well-informed decision-making.

**2. Enhanced Hospital Efficiency**

Improved resource allocation through staff-to-patient ratio and bed occupancy monitoring.
By identifying departments with lengthy wait times, ER performance was optimized.
By examining weekly admission statistics, the backlog of patients can be reduced.

**3. Financial Transparency & Budget Planning**

Assists hospitals with adequate financial planning by tracking revenue sources and analyzing treatment expenses.
Aids in locating expensive procedures and potential areas for cost improvement.

**4. Improved Patient Experience & Satisfaction**

Tracks patient input to enhance communication between patients and doctors.
Improves service delivery by pinpointing areas that could use more clarity in treatment.

**5. Data-Driven Healthcare Policy Implementation**

Assists hospitals in evaluating treatment efficacy, ICU admissions, and death rates in order to make future improvements.
Finds trends in readmissions to hospitals to enhance medical care.

**Conclusion**

A strong and clever solution that converts complicated hospital data into useful insights is the Healthcare Analytics Dashboard. It is intended to give a concise, interactive, and up-to-date summary of patient demographics, treatment trends, hospital profitability, and efficiency.
This initiative transforms how healthcare organizations track, evaluate, and enhance patient care and hospital administration by utilizing data visualization approaches, real-time analytics, and machine learning-driven insights.
Healthcare practitioners can make data-driven choices, increase operational effectiveness, and ultimately improve patient outcomes with an all-inclusive Power BI package.
